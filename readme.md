# City world

City world is a game about building cities, in a world of cities, nothing but cities.
This is part of a premium tutorial I do on liveedu. How to make a city builder clone or somthing to that effect.
In this game, we will be building cities on a "world" style 2d map,

The tutorial we cover game engine building in lisp, while we write our own programming lanugage for it as well.
The world will in a sense be represented on a voxel map.
